# Static site images

This repository contains an example image gallery and `image-targets.txt` metadata describing where in a static site those images should live.

It is intended to be read in as a subtree to its [build pipeline](https://github.com/Smaug123/static-site-pipeline).
(You could alternatively use it as a submodule, if you are happy to forgo [Nix support](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/5497).)
